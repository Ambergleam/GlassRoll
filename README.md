GlassRoll
=========

Roll dice through Glass!


Either compile the source or grab the APK [here](https://github.com/jzplusplus/GlassRoll/raw/master/bin/GlassRoll.apk) and install it using ADB.


Then just say "ok glass, roll a d20" or "ok glass, roll a d6" or "ok glass, roll a d300" to have it generate a random number between 1 and your die value.

You may need to pause for half a second between "roll a d" and the number for Glass to catch it.

Also, it currently requires an internet connection for the speech to number transcription.
